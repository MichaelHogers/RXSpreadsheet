RXSpreadsheet 1.11
==============

Changes:

* Added a NEWS.md file to track changes to the package.
* Library currently contains all necessary functions to interact with the x-spreadsheet library.
* To do: dynamic loading and saving of data. Currently a small change sends the entire data object from JS to R which is overkill for large spreadsheets.
